# Python - Back to the Basics

## 1. Objects

Everything in Python is an object, at runtime.

ie.. Anything, be it an integer, a string, or anything else, is read by the interpreter and a corresponding object is created in memory.

Only at the runtime, does the interpreter defines the object and hence the type, ie.. if it's an int or str or float or whatever.

Every object has:

	1. A single value
	2. A single type
	3. Attributes
	4. One or more base classes
	5. A single unique ID
	6. Zero, One, or more names, in one or more namespaces.
